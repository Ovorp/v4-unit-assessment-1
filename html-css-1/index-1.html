          HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content
          on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and latest major version of
          HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The
          current specification is known aas the HTML LIving Standard and is
          maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple,
          Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Apllication
          Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          HTML5 was first released in public facing form on 22 January 2008,
          with a mojor update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.
          Its goals were to improve the language with support for the lastest
          multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily
          readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and
          devices such as web browers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity;
          and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is
          intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM l Level 2
          HTML.

          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
          describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
          like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
          alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
          including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
          content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
          specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
          gapes tro share formatting by secifying the relevant CSS in a separate
          .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural
          conten. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to
          present the same markup page in different styles for different
          rendering methods, such as on-scree, in print, by voice (via
          speech-based brower or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
          devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
          accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading comes from the
          specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if
          more than one rule lmatches a particular element. Theis cascading
          priority scheme is predictable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium
          (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use
          with CSS byu RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates fa free CSS
          validation service for CSS documents. IN addition to HTML, other
          markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML,
          SVG, and XUL.
